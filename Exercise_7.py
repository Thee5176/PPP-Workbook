"""
When playing games where you have to roll two dice, it is nice to know the odds of each
roll. For instance, the odds of rolling a 12 are about 3%, and the odds of rolling a 7 are about
17%. You can compute these mathematically, but if you donâ€™t know the math, you can write
a program to do it. To do this, your program should simulate rolling two dice about 10,000
times and compute and print out the percentage of rolls that come out to be 2, 3, 4, . . . , 12.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a length in feet. The program should then give
the user the option to convert from feet into inches, yards, miles, millimeters, centimeters,
meters, or kilometers. Say if the user enters a 1, then the program converts to inches, if they
enter a 2, then the program converts to yards, etc. While this can be done with if statements,
it is much shorter with lists and it is also easier to add new conversions if you use lists.

"""
There is a provably unbreakable cipher called a one-time pad. The way it works is you shift
each character of the message by a random amount between 1 and 26 characters, wrapping
around the alphabet if necessary. For instance, if the current character is y and the shift is 5,
then the new character is d. Each character gets its own shift, so there needs to be as many
random shifts as there are characters in the message. As an example, suppose the user enters
secret. The program should generate a random shift between 1 and 26 for each character.
Suppose the randomly generated shifts are 1, 3, 2, 10, 8, and 2. The encrypted message would
be thebmv.
(a) Write a program that asks the user for a message and encrypts the message using the
one-time pad. First convert the string to lowercase. Any spaces and punctuation in the
string should be left unchanged. For example, Secret!!! becomes thebmv!!!
using the shifts above.
(b) Write a program to decrypt a string encrypted as above.
